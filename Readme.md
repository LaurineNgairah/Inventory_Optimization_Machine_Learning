# Product Demand Forecast
This project focuses on developing a robust forecasting system for a company's product sales using various time series models, including Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, SARIMA, and XGBoost. The primary objective is to analyze historical sales data and leverage these models to predict future sales trends on a weekly basis.

The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The best-performing models, SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, are highlighted for their effectiveness in capturing seasonality and delivering accurate forecasts.

A user-friendly forecasting function is implemented to allow stakeholders to generate forecasts for specific products or across all models, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning within the company.

# Objectives
 In this notebook we are going to create, evaluate and compare several models for forecasting product demand
